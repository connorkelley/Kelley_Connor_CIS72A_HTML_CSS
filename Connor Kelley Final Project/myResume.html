<h1>Connor Kelley's Resume</h1>
<p>451 Rushmore Drive, Corona, CA 92879 - kelleyconnor@outlook.com - (909)-732-2684
</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>By immersing myself in various fields of work, I have gathered experience and expanded my knowledge of teaching/coaching, business operation, project management, and facilitative maintenance. I am currently a full-time student enrolled at Riverside City College. In the near future, I plan to graduate with a BA in Computer Science. I also plan to further my education and earn a terminal degree in my field of study. 
</br>
Ultimately, my goal is to become a teacher to help students achieve their aspirations, reach their full potential, and form a sense of identity through education. I aim to inspire students and to shape their perceptions of the world through the power of knowledge and awareness.
