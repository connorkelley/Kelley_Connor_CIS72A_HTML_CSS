<p>David Foster Wallace: <br />
I admire the works of David Foster Wallace because he helped me open up my eyes and learn the true power of awareness. In his Kenyon commencement Speech, he talked about a parabolic story concerning two fish swimming in water. These fish did not know, however, that there was water all around them, all the time. Through education, David Foster Wallace says we can truly see the world--and all of it. He is my role model because his readings have truly changed my life and given me more purpose.
